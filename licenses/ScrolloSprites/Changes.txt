"About The Kid Who Stole The Relics Back" uses the modified Scroll-o-Sprites tileset.

I made the changes as stated below.

1. While the tileset originally is meant as 16x16px, I adapted it to the game grid that is 18x18px. For most sprites, I just added 1px transparent background on the every side. Exception is the wall tile - the right side of the wall was slightly cut off.
2. All tiles are white (instead of original color: #eeeecc), and I replaced the original background (#111133) with the transparent one. 
3. The "cross.png" tile has been enlarged a little.
4. Originally, the "looking" tile has the additional circle in the middle (original tile you can find in the "Symbols" group in the original Scroll-o-sprites.
5. "pillar.png" is tile made by me, and it is not part of the Scroll-o-sprites tileset.
6. "viking.png" and "vikingangry.png" are modified "Charaters" from the original tileset. The "viking.png" smiles, and "vikingangry.png" has does not, and holds his sword higher.
7. The shape of "stone.png" and and "heart.png" remains the same as original, but there are additional "stoneempty.png" and "heartempty.png" tiles that have only the contour remaining.

The original tileset is redistributed with game archive, in "data/tiles/original_tileset" directory.
