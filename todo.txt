- enemies' cone FOV

- environmental interactions, like throwing a bottles to stagger an enemy

- start with unexplored dungeon

- sometimes player can't hide from the enemy even if it is out of FOV - depends on the distance?

- tiles:
    - angry viking
    - footsteps
    - pebble
    - "ranged" - looking (both icon and UI), firing
