- enemies' cone FOV

- environmental interactions, like throwing a bottles to stagger an enemy

- start with unexplored dungeon

- maybe hidden player should have shorter FOV? it would need adding some kind of "footsteps" system

- NEED TO FIX A BUG: enemies stop chasing you as soon as you break the FOV - it also means that they won't follow you through the doors!
