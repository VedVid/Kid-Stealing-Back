- enemies should chase player if triggered, but also give up if player would remain out of their FOV for some time (so they should remember the last position where they see the player and move towards *this* position)

- furniture, holes in the walls to allow player hide

- enemies' cone FOV

- environmental interactions, like throwing a bottles to stagger an enemy

- start with unexplored dungeon
