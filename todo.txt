- enemies' cone FOV

- environmental interactions, like throwing a bottles to stagger an enemy

- start with unexplored dungeon

- NEED TO CHECK WHAT IS DEFAULT STATE OF LAST SAW AND HOW IT MUTATES

- High Scores etc

- add penalties for multiple hatching

- FIX: I still can drop multiple treasures on one tile
