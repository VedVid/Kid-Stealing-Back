- enemies should chase player if triggered, but also give up if player would remain out of their FOV for some time (so they should remember the last position where they see the player and move towards *this* position)

- enemies' cone FOV

- environmental interactions, like throwing a bottles to stagger an enemy

- start with unexplored dungeon

- dropping items

- speed should decrease with encumbrance

- maybe with full enc player should not be allowed to use some spots to hide?

- maybe hidden player should have shorter FOV? it would need adding some kind of "footsteps" system

- CHECK SOURCE <---> TARGET IN FOV FUNCTIONS
